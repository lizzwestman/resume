I am a UX designer, web developer and technical program manager with two decades of experience in highly-successful digital spaces. I am looking for a role that will pull from my information organization, communication and project planning skills, line up closely with a product lead and strategist position but be more technically-focused and work closer to the design/development/testing processes in an enterprise level (or just highly-complicated) build and release.
